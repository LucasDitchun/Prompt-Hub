#### Step 1: Information Gathering and Contextualization  

Before creating the budget, collect detailed information to fully understand the project’s purpose, scope, and constraints. Ask relevant and strategic questions to gather critical data, such as:  

1. **About the Business:**  
   - What is the sector or type of operation for the new unit? (e.g., manufacturing, technology, services).  
   - What are the primary objectives? (e.g., revenue growth, cost optimization, ROI).  

2. **Financial Details:**  
   - Is there an initial budget or investment cap available?  
   - Are there internal benchmarks or industry standards for comparison?  

3. **Operational and External Factors:**  
   - What external factors could influence financial performance? (e.g., seasonality, economic trends, regulations).  
   - Are there known risks, such as currency volatility, that need to be addressed?  

4. **User Preferences:**  
   - Should the budget be conservative, moderate, or aggressive?  
   - Are there specific metrics, such as EBITDA or adjusted cash flow, to include?  

**Note:** Always adjust the approach based on the user’s responses to ensure the model is tailored to their specific needs.

#### Step 2: Structuring the Budget and Forecast  

Develop a comprehensive budget that includes the following elements:  

1. **Revenues:**  
   - Estimate revenue sources based on realistic projections (sales, subscriptions, contracts, etc.).  
   - Differentiate between recurring and one-time revenues.  

2. **Expenses:**  
   - Detail fixed and variable costs.  
   - Include categories such as rent, payroll, marketing, R&D, and technology.  

3. **Cash Flow:**  
   - Provide monthly cash flow projections.  
   - Identify critical low-liquidity periods and suggest strategies to manage them.  

4. **Financial Risks and Mitigation:**  
   - Highlight key risks, such as client defaults, unexpected costs, or market shifts.  
   - Propose strategies to mitigate these risks, like currency hedging or expense reduction.  

5. **Alternative Scenarios:**  
   - Best Case: Based on exceeding goals.  
   - Conservative Case: When goals are only partially met.  
   - Worst Case: For underperforming scenarios.  

6. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**  
   - Include metrics such as profit margin, customer acquisition cost (CAC), payback period, and EBITDA.

#### Step 3: Output Format and Presentation  

Request the output in the following structured format:  

1. **Executive Summary:**  
   - A clear summary of the key projections, conclusions, and recommendations.  

2. **Detailed Table:**  
   - A month-by-month budget table with columns for revenue, fixed and variable costs, operating profit, and cash flow.  
   - Include scenario comparisons.  

3. **Graphical Visualizations:**  
   - Charts for revenues, expenses, and cash flow over time.  
   - Pie charts for expense category proportions.  

4. **Insights and Strategic Recommendations:**  
   - Highlight opportunities or improvement areas.  
   - Propose actionable steps, such as renegotiating contracts, prioritizing investments, or reviewing cost structures.

#### Step 4: Adjustment and Interactivity  

Instruct the model to iterate based on user feedback:  
- "Based on this initial information, is there anything you would like to adjust or expand before finalizing the budget and forecast?"  
- "What other priorities would you like to include in this financial planning process?"  

Include a note to further customize the budget as new information becomes available.

**Initial Question to Start the Process:**  

"To begin crafting this budget and forecast, could you briefly describe the nature of the business, the main financial goals, and any specific constraints to consider?"  
```
