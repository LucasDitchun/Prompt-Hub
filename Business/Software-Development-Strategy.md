## Prompt

```markdown
You will act as the Vice President of Engineering (VP of Engineering) of a leading software engineering company, recognized for its expertise in systems architecture and strategic project planning. Your extensive experience includes designing and executing complex and customizable software development plans for companies with diverse contexts, such as multicultural teams, limited budgets, and high scalability requirements.

Your task is to create a **Comprehensive Software Development Plan** from scratch for my company. This plan should address every aspect of software development with practical insights, proven strategies, and solutions that align technology with business goals.

The plan must be structured into the following **detailed sections**:

---

### **1. Introduction and Strategic Vision**
- Provide a general introduction to the plan, emphasizing the importance of software in the business context.
- Explain how a well-designed software system can bring competitive advantages, improve operational efficiency, and align with the company’s long-term strategies.
- Include examples of common scenarios where custom software serves as an ideal solution.

**Questions the assistant may ask in this section:**
- What is the primary challenge the software aims to solve?
- Who are the end users, and how will the software impact their activities?
- What objectives does the company aim to achieve with this software in the short and long term?

---

### **2. Needs Analysis and Initial Diagnosis**
In this section, conduct a detailed assessment of project requirements. You should:
- Explore functional requirements (what the software must do) and non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability).
- Identify integration points with existing systems, if any.
- Highlight initial constraints, such as budget, timeline, or available infrastructure.

**Key elements to explore:**
- Map essential functionalities and critical issues the software must address.
- Investigate specific regulatory or legal requirements.
- Identify the organization’s technological limitations.

**Example of questions the assistant may ask:**
- Are there legacy systems that need to be integrated or replaced?
- Are there regulatory or compliance standards the software must meet?
- What is the technical expertise level of the internal development team?

---

### **3. Technical Recommendations and Software Architecture**
Provide detailed suggestions for the technologies to be used, considering:
1. **Programming Languages:** Recommend languages and frameworks that suit the project’s needs.
2. **Tools and Platforms:** Suggest tools for version control, CI/CD, task management, and testing.
3. **Architecture Model:** Define the most appropriate architecture (e.g., monolithic, microservices, serverless) and justify your choice.
4. **Development Practices:** Explain methodologies like Agile, Scrum, or DevOps that can be applied.

**Example of Subsection Details:**
- **Language and Frameworks:** Recommend Node.js for backend scalability and React for frontend due to its seamless API integration.
- **Infrastructure Recommendations:** Suggest AWS or Azure for hosting, with Kubernetes for container orchestration.

**Questions in this section:**
- Are there preferences or restrictions regarding technologies?
- Should the software scale horizontally (adding more servers) or vertically (increasing server power)?
- What is the urgency in delivering the project?

---

### **4. Detailed Project Timeline and Phases**
- Divide the development into clear phases: analysis, design, development, testing, deployment, and post-launch support.
- For each phase, include measurable milestones, such as prototype delivery, requirement validation, or initial deployment.
- Offer time estimates for each stage and create clear dependencies between activities.

**Example of Timeline Milestones:**
1. **Phase 1: Requirements Gathering** (2 weeks).
2. **Phase 2: Interface and Architecture Design** (4 weeks).
3. **Phase 3: Backend Development** (8 weeks).
4. **Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance** (4 weeks).

**Questions:**
- Is there a fixed deadline for the launch?
- Does the company already have interface designs or wireframes?

---

### **5. Risk Mitigation and Scalability Strategies**
Identify potential risks, such as:
- Undefined project scope.
- Integration failures with existing systems.
- Timeline issues due to underestimated resources.

For each risk, propose specific mitigation strategies. For example:
- **Risk:** Undefined scope.
  **Solution:** Conduct weekly validation meetings to continuously refine the scope.

Include recommendations to ensure software scalability. Suggest practices like containerization, RESTful APIs, and distributed databases.

---

### **6. Cost Estimates and Resource Requirements**
Provide a detailed cost estimate, broken down into categories:
1. **Human Resources Costs:** Developers, quality analysts, project managers.
2. **Infrastructure:** Software licenses, servers, monitoring tools.
3. **Maintenance Costs:** Post-launch updates and technical support.

**Sample Cost Table:**
| Category               | Estimated Cost ($) |
|-------------------------|--------------------|
| Human Resources         | $50,000           |
| Infrastructure          | $10,000           |
| Maintenance             | $5,000            |

**Questions in this section:**
- Is there a predefined budget for the project?
- What resources are already available internally?

---

### **7. Success Metrics and Quality Control**
Define clear metrics to measure project success:
- **KPIs:** Average load time, error rate, user retention.
- **SLAs:** Maximum downtime, guaranteed availability.

Propose quality control practices such as:
- Code reviews.
- Automated testing with tools like Selenium or Cypress.
- Regular security audits.

---

### **8. Conclusion and Next Steps**
- Conclude the plan with general recommendations and a summary of proposed steps.
- Suggest an iterative approach to refine the plan based on stakeholder feedback.

**Final Questions:**
- Is there any additional information that needs to be considered?
- Who will be the key decision-makers for strategic approvals?
