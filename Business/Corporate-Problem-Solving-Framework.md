### Framework Structure ###

**1. In-Depth Problem Analysis**
The framework should begin with a thorough examination of the problem. This phase should include:
- **Problem Definition and Contextualization**:
  - Key questions: What is the problem? How does it impact the organization?
  - Suggested tools: Ishikawa Diagram, root cause analysis, process mapping.
- **Data Collection and Analysis**:
  - What data is needed to fully understand the problem?
  - Collection methods: Stakeholder interviews, quantitative surveys, operational audits.
- **Organizational Context**:
  - What cultural, political, or economic factors influence the problem?
  - Identify communication or resource gaps that may underlie the issue.

**2. Stakeholder Identification and Alignment**
- List and categorize stakeholders (internal and external) directly or indirectly involved.
- Identify conflicting interests and strategies to achieve consensus.
- Develop an influence map to position stakeholders based on their power and interest in the issue.

**3. Creative and Innovative Solution Generation**
This phase should prioritize creativity and practical feasibility. Include:
- **Brainstorming and Evaluation Techniques**:
  - Use methodologies such as SCAMPER, Design Thinking, or facilitated brainstorming sessions.
- **Evaluation Criteria**:
  - Prioritize solutions based on potential impact, cost, implementation timeline, and alignment with organizational goals.
- **Prototyping and Testing**:
  - Suggest rapid prototyping or pilot programs before scaling the solution.
  - Suggested tools: Minimum Viable Product (MVP), A/B testing, simulations based on historical data.

**4. Strategy Planning and Implementation**
This phase details how the chosen solutions will be executed.
- **Goal and KPI Setting**:
  - Establish SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound).
  - Identify critical KPIs to track progress in real-time.
- **Resource Planning**:
  - Determine the necessary human, financial, and technological resources.
  - Include contingency plans to address unforeseen challenges.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**:
  - Create clear timelines with defined milestones.
  - Propose regular checkpoints to assess progress.

**5. Results Evaluation and Continuous Improvement**
Post-implementation analysis is crucial to ensure success and document lessons learned.
- **Feedback Collection**:
  - Conduct internal and external surveys with stakeholders to evaluate outcomes.
- **Impact Measurement**:
  - Compare results against established goals and revise the KPIs used.
- **Final Reporting and Future Planning**:
  - Document key learnings and integrate insights into continuous improvement processes.
  - Propose adaptations for future frameworks.

   List practical limitations such as budget, time restrictions, availability of resources, and cultural or market limitations.

5. **Methodological Inspirations**
   Suggest the framework be constructed based on the following established methodologies:
   - Lean Six Sigma (to reduce waste and optimize processes).
   - SWOT Analysis (for situational analysis).
   - Design Thinking (for a human-centered and creative approach).
