### **Detailed Instructions**
#### **1. Framework Structure**
The framework should follow a structured approach divided into **numbered sections**. Be sure to include the following key stages:
- **Problem Analysis**
  1. Explain how to identify and describe the problem comprehensively and in detail.
  2. Present techniques to map root causes, such as the 5 Whys method, Ishikawa diagrams, or other diagnostic tools.
  3. Propose methods to gather data effectively, such as interviews, surveys, or historical data analysis.

- **Stakeholder Engagement**
  1. Develop strategies to identify key stakeholders and map their needs and expectations.
  2. Define how to create clear and transparent communication channels to keep stakeholders aligned throughout the process.
  3. Include techniques to manage conflicts and negotiate priorities among stakeholders.

- **Solution Generation**
  1. Present creative methodologies for generating solutions, such as structured brainstorming, SCAMPER, or Design Thinking.
  2. Explain how to validate the technical and financial feasibility of the ideas generated.
  3. Include ways to prioritize solutions based on potential impact and ease of implementation.

- **Strategy Implementation**
  1. Detail steps to convert solutions into actionable plans with clear timelines, resources, and accountability.
  2. Include practices to manage organizational changes during implementation, such as team training and internal communication.
  3. Provide guidelines for monitoring progress and adjusting strategies as needed.

- **Evaluation and Learning**
  1. Explain how to define clear and actionable success metrics to measure the impact of the implemented solutions.
  2. Include methods to collect ongoing feedback from involved parties.
  3. Describe how to capture lessons learned to improve future problem-solving processes.

- **Risk Management and Mitigation** (Optional)
  1. Provide techniques to identify potential risks early in the process.
  2. Propose strategies for proactive risk mitigation.
  3. Detail how to respond quickly to unforeseen issues during execution.

#### **2. Customized Context**
Consider the following user-provided elements when designing the framework:
- **Problem Description**: Insert a clear and detailed description of the problem.
- **Stakeholders**: List the involved parties and explain how they influence the solution process.
- **Desired Outcomes**: Specify the objectives the user seeks to achieve.
- **Constraints**: Include financial, time, or other relevant limitations.

#### **3. Integration of Methodologies**
1. Use insights from established methodologies, such as "[Methodology 1]" and "[Methodology 2]" to inform the framework.
2. Explain why these methodologies are relevant to the presented problem.
3. Integrate these approaches into each stage of the framework.

#### **4. Applied Example**
Provide examples that demonstrate how to apply the framework in real-world scenarios, such as:
- **Context**: "A technology company is facing recurring delays in new product development."
- **Tool Example**: "Using the Kanban method to improve workflow and reduce bottlenecks."
- **Outcome Example**: "Achieving a 25% reduction in project delivery time."

#### **5. Formatting and Tone**
1. Present the framework in a clear, structured, and accessible manner, using bullet points or numbered steps.
2. Use a professional, direct, and action-oriented tone.
3. Ensure the language is inclusive and avoids excessive technical jargon.

#### **6. Iterative Adaptation**
Incorporate the possibility of customizing or adjusting the framework based on the user’s specific needs. Ask follow-up questions such as:
- "Are there any unique aspects of the problem that should be considered?"
- "What are the biggest challenges in implementing a solution like this?"
