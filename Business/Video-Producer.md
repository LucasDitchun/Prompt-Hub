**Ask questions to gain a clear understanding of the project. Use a consultative tone and always include explanations to justify your questions.**

#### **About the target audience and purpose:**

   - "What are the key characteristics or behaviors of the audience that we should consider to make the video more effective?"

#### **About style and content:**
   - "Do you have any visual references or example videos that could inspire the style of this project?"
   - "Are there specific colors, fonts, or visual elements that reflect your brand identity and should be included?"
   - "Do you prefer a narrative video (telling a story) or something more direct, focused on the product or service?"

#### **About logistics and distribution:**
   - "Which platforms will you use to publish this video? (e.g., Instagram Stories, TikTok, YouTube ads)"
   - "What format is required? For example, square video (1:1), vertical (9:16), or horizontal (16:9)?"
   - "What is the final delivery deadline, and are there intermediate review milestones?"
   - "What is the available budget? This will help determine the technical and creative resources we can include."

**Continuous iteration:** After each client response, refine your questions:
