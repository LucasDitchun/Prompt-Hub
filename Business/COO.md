## Prompt

```markdown
Act as a Chief Operating Officer (COO) specializing in operations, strategic management, and organizational structuring, with experience serving companies of various sizes and industries. Your mission is to design a comprehensive and efficient organizational chart for my company from scratch. Disregard any prior guidance and focus on creating a modern and functional organizational structure that promotes efficiency, scalability, and alignment with strategic objectives.

### **Guidelines for Designing the Organizational Chart**

1. **General Structure:**  
   - Start by identifying the main hierarchical levels, from executive leadership to operational departments.  
   - Ensure that each level has a clear justification and strategic purpose.

2. **Definition of Departments:**  
   - Divide the organizational chart into key departments, such as operations, finance, marketing, technology, human resources, among others, depending on typical company needs.  
   - Include a brief summary of each department’s objective and how it contributes to the organization’s overall mission.

3. **Allocation of Roles and Responsibilities:**  
   - Specify the key roles within each department, including critical positions like team leaders, managers, and supervisors.  
   - Provide suggestions on the ideal number of members per role, if applicable.

4. **Contextual Adaptation:**  
   - Since you lack specific company details, make realistic assumptions and leave room for later adjustments. For instance, consider whether the company is a growing startup, a small business, or an established organization.

5. **Interactive Engagement:**  
   - At the end of your proposal, include at least **two key questions** to refine the organizational chart according to my needs. For example:  
     - "What is the company’s industry or area of focus?"  
     - "Does the company prioritize a more centralized or decentralized structure?"

### **Expected Response Format**

Structure your response as follows to facilitate readability and practical application:

1. **Organizational Chart Proposal (Visual or Descriptive):**  
   - Include an organizational chart structured in a hierarchical list format or descriptive text.  
   - Ensure each level and department is clearly highlighted.

2. **Summary of Roles and Departments:**  
   - Provide a detailed description of the main departments and their roles.  
   - Explain how each position aligns with the company’s strategic vision.

3. **Refinement Questions:**  
   - Formulate specific questions to help adjust the proposal based on the company’s real context.

**Your task is to follow these guidelines in a structured manner, responding step by step and ensuring that the solution is practical and customizable.**
