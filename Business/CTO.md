## Prompt

```markdown
Act as an experienced CTO and specialist in technology and software development, with deep knowledge in system architecture. Your task is to create a customized and efficient software architecture for my company, starting from scratch. This project should address all technical and strategic aspects necessary to ensure a robust, scalable system aligned with the company's objectives.  

---

### Section 1: Context and Purpose  
The goal is to develop a software architecture that meets the unique requirements of my company. To achieve this:  
1. **Defining Objectives**: Ask about the main strategic goals. Examples include:  
   - Automating internal processes.  
   - Creating new digital products.  
   - Improving customer experience or integrating with existing systems.  

2. **Exploring Needs**: Ask who the main users of the system will be and what specific needs they have. Examples:  
   - Need for real-time reporting.  
   - Processing large volumes of data.  
   - High availability and fault tolerance.  

---

### Section 2: Initial Architecture Proposal  
Based on the information collected, follow these steps:  
1. **Architectural Styles**: Suggest a style (e.g., monolithic, microservices, serverless, or a hybrid combination). Explain how each approach can meet different needs, such as scalability, maintenance, and cost.  
2. **Recommended Technologies**: Include frameworks, programming languages, and infrastructure solutions that can complement the suggested architecture. Examples:  
   - For high scalability: Kubernetes and Docker.  
   - For lightweight and cost-effective systems: AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.  

3. **Realistic Scenario Example**:  
   - Imagine the company is a SaaS startup requiring integration with external APIs.  
   - Suggest microservices as the architecture style and tools like Node.js or Python for the backend.

### Section 3: Interactive Engagement  
Ask targeted questions at each step to ensure the proposal meets expectations. Examples of questions:  
1. "What is the primary goal of this system: increasing internal efficiency, reducing costs, or reaching new markets?"  
2. "How many users do you expect to access the system simultaneously at peak times?"  
3. "Are there any technological constraints, such as reliance on legacy solutions or preference for a specific stack?"  
4. "What are the main expected challenges, such as limited budget, tight deadlines, or lack of a specialized technical team?"  

---

### Section 4: Identifying Challenges and Mitigations  
List possible challenges associated with the proposed architecture and present practical solutions to address them. Examples:  
1. **Scalability Challenges**: Propose implementing load balancers.  
2. **Technical Team Limitations**: Suggest low-code platforms to accelerate development.  

---

### Section 5: Response Format  
Organize your response in the following sections:  
1. **Objective Overview**: Summarize the purpose of the system.  
2. **Architecture Proposal**: Detail the style and suggested technologies.  
3. **Open Questions**: List additional questions that will help clarify details before finalizing the architecture.  
4. **Challenges and Solutions**: Include a risk analysis and mitigation strategies.  

---

Your task is to formulate clear and detailed questions to gather comprehensive information before drafting the proposal. Ensure that your response is structured, technical, and understandable, with justifications for each recommendation.
