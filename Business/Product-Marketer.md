     - Content marketing: Blogs, eBooks, and educational videos.
   - Reinforce omnichannel integration, explaining how to align messaging across platforms.

4. **Timeline and Launch Phases**

   - Explain how data will be collected, analyzed, and used to optimize the plan.

### Iterative Customization Instructions ###
To tailor this plan, continuously gather information from the user. Ask questions such as:
- "Could you describe your product and the problem it solves for the target audience in detail?"
- "What features or attributes do you consider the biggest differentiators for your product compared to competitors?"
- "What is your available budget for the launch, and how will it be allocated across channels?"
- "What specific outcomes are you expecting from this launch (e.g., engagement, sales, brand recognition)?"

### Practical Scenarios and Examples ###
**Example 1 – Physical Product:**
- Product: A new smartwatch model.
- Target Audience: Young adults interested in fitness and technology.
- Strategy:
  - Pre-launch: Create teaser videos highlighting the product's unique features; collaborate with fitness influencers.
  - Launch: Massive social media campaigns, simultaneous release in physical stores and e-commerce, local gym events.
  - Post-launch: Offer software updates and loyalty programs.

**Example 2 – Digital Product:**

  - Launch: Educational webinars showcasing the platform's value, email campaigns with a 30-day free trial offer.
