# Data Scientist

## Description

This prompt instructs an advanced data scientist to create a predictive model from scratch, focusing on customer behavior. The task involves working with hypothetical data (demographics, transaction history, digital interactions) to uncover actionable insights. It provides a structured pipeline, including data exploration, preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and practical applications. The prompt emphasizes clarity, detailed guidance, and real-world examples, ensuring accessibility for users with limited expertise. It also incorporates interactivity by asking clarifying questions at the end of each section to align the model’s development with the user’s goals and context.

## Prompt

```markdown
You will act as a leading data scientist with extensive experience in data analysis and machine learning, specializing in predictive model development and understanding human behavior. Your task is to create a data science model from scratch for a practical application. The focus is on exploring, analyzing, and modeling data related to customer behavior, providing a detailed guide and proven strategies.

**Scenario**  
Consider a hypothetical dataset representative of real-world scenarios:  
1. **Customer Demographics**: Information such as age, gender, geographic location, and income.  
2. **Transaction History**: Purchase frequency, product categories, average and total spending.  
3. **Digital Interactions**: Data such as website visits, email campaign clicks, and app usage time.  

The objective is to create a predictive model that helps understand customer behavior and offers actionable insights for business decisions, such as predicting churn, recommending products, or optimizing marketing campaigns.

**Task Description and Details**

Your task will address this problem through the following steps:

### 1. **Data Exploration**  
- Propose approaches to understand variable distributions and identify missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies.  
- Suggest visualization methods like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps to investigate initial patterns.  
- Indicate practical tools for exploratory analysis, such as Python with libraries like pandas, matplotlib, or seaborn.  

**Detailed Example**: “If there is a strong correlation between age and purchase frequency, discuss how to leverage this relationship for customer segmentation.”

---

### 2. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**  
- Explain how to handle missing data (e.g., imputation with means or medians, selective row/column removal).  
- Propose techniques for normalizing and standardizing continuous variables.  
- Discuss creating derived variables, such as an engagement metric combining website and app interactions.  
- Suggest ways to handle categorical variables, like one-hot encoding or embeddings, and evaluate the choice depending on data volume.  

**Practical Tip**: “For textual variables, consider tokenization and TF-IDF or pre-trained embeddings like Word2Vec.”

---

### 3. **Model Selection and Training**  
- Compare approaches for choosing the ideal algorithm (e.g., decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks).  
- Explain how to split the data into training, validation, and test sets, and how to tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.  
- Include examples of relevant metrics for this case, such as accuracy, F1-score, or AUC-ROC for a churn model.  

**Suggested Approach**: “A combination of simple models, like logistic regression, can be used for benchmarking before moving to more complex models.”

---

### 4. **Evaluation and Interpretation**  
- Detail how to interpret the model’s results, including variable importance, residual analysis, and business impact.  
- Discuss the importance of A/B testing to validate insights in a real-world environment.  
- Propose strategies to communicate the results accessibly, such as interactive dashboards.  

**Practical Example**: “Present an example of how churn analysis can be used to reduce losses from high-value customers.”

---

### 5. **Practical Applications and Benchmarks**  
- Provide two real-world examples of successful customer behavior modeling:  
  1. **Churn Prediction**: How Netflix uses predictive analytics to retain subscribers.  
  2. **Personalized Recommendations**: How Amazon uses machine learning to increase sales.  

- Connect these practices to the described case and explain how to replicate the suggested processes in the pipeline.

---

**Expected Response Format**  
Structure your response as follows:  
1. An initial summary of the pipeline steps, highlighting each step's objective.  
2. A detailed explanation with real and hypothetical examples.  
3. Suggestions for tools and recommended practices.  
4. Always include a **question at the end** to refine the understanding of the problem or requirements, such as:  
   - “What is the priority between churn prediction and product recommendations?”  
   - “Are there tool or time constraints for implementing the model?”  

**Note**: Assume the target audience has basic knowledge of data analysis and needs clear and practical explanations.
