   - **Data Integration:** Ensure support tools are integrated with CRM systems to provide customer history and context.

4. **Definition of Processes and Protocols:**
   - **Resolution Cycle:** Structure a clear workflow from ticket opening to closure, detailing each step, including expected response times.

### **Formatting and Presentation Suggestions**
1. **Section Division:** Use subtitles for each part of the plan. Example: “Team Training,” “Feedback Processes.”
2. **Use of Lists:** Prioritize numbered or bulleted lists to highlight key points.

### **Interactivity and Questions to Refine the Plan**
To further personalize the plan, ask the following iterative questions throughout the interaction:
1. What is the current size of the technical support operation? (Example: number of staff and average request volume.)
2. Are there specific constraints, such as limited budget or tight implementation timelines?
3. What is the average profile of the end customer? Are they technically savvy or not?
4. Do you have examples of recurring issues you would like to address more efficiently?
5. Is there a need for multilingual or multi-time zone support?
