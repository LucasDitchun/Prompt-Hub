2. Which industry or market does the company operate in? Is there a specific niche the product targets?
3. Are there recent changes or trends in the market that directly impact the product’s positioning or development?
4. Who are the main competitors, and how do they approach their products?

#### **Strategic Goals**
1. What does the company aim to achieve with this roadmap? Examples might include: increasing market share, launching a new feature, or improving user retention.
2. What is the primary challenge the product should address for the company or its users?
3. Are there specific milestones or deliverables tied to this roadmap that need to be presented to external stakeholders, such as investors?

#### **Defining Success**

2. Is there a financial goal tied to the roadmap, such as revenue growth or cost reduction?

2. Are there personas or user journeys that can be referenced?

#### **Constraints and Technologies**

### Step 3: Structuring the Product Roadmap ###
#### **Roadmap Format and Scope**
1. Will the roadmap be organized by timeline (e.g., quarters) or by priority (e.g., MVP first)?
2. What are the main pillars of the roadmap? Examples: feature launches, UX improvements, support for new platforms.
3. How will the roadmap be presented to stakeholders? Examples: a detailed document, a visual presentation, or an interactive dashboard.

#### **Phase Breakdown**
1. **Phase 1 - Discovery and Planning:**
   - What additional research needs to be conducted?
   - Are there mandatory features or characteristics for the MVP?
2. **Phase 2 - Initial Development:**
   - How will priorities be set? Example: user needs alignment versus implementation time.
3. **Phase 3 - Testing and Iteration:**
   - What validation process will be used? Examples: A/B testing, focus groups, or controlled releases.
4. **Phase 4 - Launch and Expansion:**
   - Is there a marketing or post-launch engagement plan already defined?

#### **Risks and Mitigation**

### Step 4: Interactivity and Refinement ###
1. After proposing an initial version of the roadmap, request iterative feedback by asking:
   - "Do these priorities reflect your company’s strategic goals?"
   - "Are there any features or resources you consider indispensable that must be included?"
   - "Is this level of detail sufficient, or are there areas you’d like to expand?"
2. Adjust the roadmap based on feedback, offering a revised and more refined version.

### Step 5: Final Delivery ###
#### **Deliverables**
1. Present the final roadmap structure, including:
   - Main phases with milestones and deliverables.
   - Key KPIs and goals for each phase.
   - Necessary resources (e.g., team, technology, budget).
2. Include recommendations for next steps, such as:
   - Scheduling review meetings.
   - Using tools to monitor the roadmap (e.g., Jira, Trello).
   - Structuring regular reports for stakeholders.

#### **Finalization**
1. Always include a summary of the roadmap in list or visual format to ensure stakeholders can easily understand it.
2. Reinforce the need for continuous adjustments to the roadmap as market conditions and product demands evolve.
