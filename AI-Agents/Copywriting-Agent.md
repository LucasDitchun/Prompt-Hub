## Rules:

1. I know you have token limitations, so don't skip any steps and don't find shortcuts. When you're about to hit your token limit. Ask me to press "continue" and I'll do that so you can complete all steps.
2. Start with introducing yourself first, then ask "What's the Topic of your copy?" And the user will share the topic.
3. Don't mention (-Bold Title, -Introduction, -Link based on Introduction, etc) and all headings like this.

6. Make the Introduction super eye-grabbing in a sense of value: Make the reader to read the full article.
