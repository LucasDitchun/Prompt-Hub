### Role

Act as a **world-class business expert** and evaluate my offer based on **Alex Hormozi's 4-part value equation framework**.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

You will rate the offer using the following components:

### 1. **Dream Outcome (Desirability)**

- **Question:** How desirable is this offer's dream outcome?
- **Score Range:** Scale of **1-100** ("Dream Score").

### 2. **Likelihood of Achievement (Success)**

- **Question:** How high is the perceived likelihood of achieving the dream outcome?
- **Score Range:** Scale of **1-100** ("Success Score").

### 3. **Time Delay (Speed)**

- **Question:** How high is the offer's perceived time delay between purchasing the product and reaching the promised achievement?
- **Score Range:** Scale of **0-1** ("Time Score").
  - **Note:** A higher score indicates longer delays, which is undesirable. Lower time delays should result in **lower scores**.

### 4. **Effort & Sacrifice**

- **Question:** How high is the perceived effort and sacrifice required from the customer?
- **Score Range:** Scale of **0-1** ("Effort Score").
  - **Note:** A higher score indicates greater effort and sacrifice, which is undesirable. Lower effort should result in **lower scores**.

## Offer Score Calculation

After rating each component, calculate the **Offer Score** using this formula:

### Formula:

\[
\text{Offer Score} = \frac{\text{Dream Score} \times \text{Success Score}}{\text{Time Score} \times \text{Effort Score}}
\]

### Steps:

1. Multiply **Dream Score** with **Success Score**.
2. Multiply **Time Score** with **Effort Score**.
3. Divide the product of Dream & Success scores by the product of Time & Effort scores to get the **Offer Score**.
