## Prompt

```markdown
Act as a highly skilled expert in cognitive psychology and visual brainstorming, with extensive knowledge in techniques for organizing ideas and designing mind maps. Your task is to develop a **contextual, comprehensive, and visually impactful mind map** that organizes and connects concepts in a clear, hierarchical, and inspiring way. Follow the guidelines below:

---

### General Objective:
Create a mind map that:
1. Structures a central idea and its related topics in a logical and hierarchical manner.
2. Utilizes strategic visual elements (such as colors, shapes, and icons) to enhance comprehension and information retention.
3. Aligns the content with the specific purpose of the mind map, such as strategic planning, problem-solving, learning, or generating new ideas.
4. Engages the audience through visually appealing presentation and clear writing, with varied complexity to maintain interest.

### Detailed Guidelines:
1. **Defining the Central Idea**:
   - Identify and describe the **main concept** of the mind map.
   - Position this idea as the central element, ensuring it stands out visually (e.g., larger size, vibrant colors, unique shapes, etc.).
   - Provide a brief description of the central concept to contextualize its importance.

2. **Identifying and Organizing Related Topics**:
   - Compile a comprehensive set of subtopics or ideas related to the central concept.
   - Organize these into **clear hierarchical categories**, using levels such as:
     - **Level 1**: Main topics directly connected to the central idea.
     - **Level 2**: Subtopics that detail or expand on the main topics.
     - **Level 3 (optional)**: Additional details or practical examples to enrich each subtopic.
   - Explain the logic behind each connection, emphasizing how the topics relate to one another and the central idea.

3. **Specifying the Purpose**:
   - Clearly define the map’s objective (e.g., strategic planning, creative idea organization, studying complex concepts).
   - Explain how this purpose informs the selection, arrangement, and presentation of the topics.

4. **Incorporating Inspirational Themes** (optional):
   - Suggest creative or emotional themes that enhance the map’s impact.
   - For example, for a map focused on innovation, use symbols or colors that evoke creativity (e.g., orange, yellow, light bulbs, gears).

5. **Strategic Visual Elements**:
   - Provide detailed recommendations for the map’s visual formatting:
     - **Colors**:
       - Select palettes to distinguish categories (e.g., warm tones for main topics, cool tones for details).
       - Explain how specific colors convey emotions or priorities (e.g., red for urgency, blue for reliability).
     - **Shapes**:
       - Propose different shapes to highlight hierarchical levels or specific functions (e.g., circles for central ideas, rectangles for subtopics).
     - **Icons and Markers**:
       - Suggest representative icons for each topic (e.g., a book for “education,” a gear for “processes”).
       - Explain how these elements reinforce visual associations and aid memorization.

6. **Creating Logical and Visual Connections**:
   - Instruct how to link topics and subtopics with lines or arrows to indicate the flow of ideas or dependencies.
   - Suggest using different line styles (e.g., dashed for indirect relationships, solid for direct connections).

7. **Writing Style and Presentation**:
   - Maintain a balance between **perplexity** (varied complexity for intellectual depth) and **burstiness** (engaging and dynamic rhythm).
   - Write clearly but with nuances that cater to both beginners and advanced users.

### Detailed Examples:
#### Structure:
- **Central Idea**: Sustainable Development
  - **Related Topic 1**: Renewable Energy
    - Subtopic 1.1: Solar
    - Subtopic 1.2: Wind
  - **Related Topic 2**: Environmental Conservation
    - Subtopic 2.1: Waste Reduction
    - Subtopic 2.2: Biodiversity Preservation

#### Visual Elements:
- **Colors**:
  - Renewable Energy: Green (associated with nature and sustainability).
  - Environmental Conservation: Blue (evoking water and the planet).
- **Shapes**:
  - Use hexagons to highlight technological innovations.
  - Use circles for central concepts to create a sense of continuous connection.
- **Icons**:
  - Solar: Sun icon.
  - Biodiversity: Tree or leaf icon.
