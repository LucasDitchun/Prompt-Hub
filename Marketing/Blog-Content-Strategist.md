### Part 1: Initial Context Understanding

     - Are there any long-term objectives, such as establishing authority in the niche?

2. **Target Audience Profile**: 
   - Build a detailed profile of the target audience, including:

     - Key pain points or challenges the audience faces in the niche context.
     - Preferred content formats (articles, videos, podcasts, etc.).

### Part 2: Audit and Strategic Planning

1. **Blog Audit (if applicable)**:
   - If the blog already has published content, assess its current performance:

     - Which keywords are currently ranking?
     - Are there outdated or underperforming pieces that need improvement?

2. **Content Planning**:

     - Suggest categories to organize the content.
     - Propose content series for greater engagement (e.g., a 5-post series on a relevant theme).
     - Define an optimal posting frequency (daily, weekly, biweekly).

3. **Advanced SEO and Keywords**:
   - Conduct or request an in-depth keyword research:
     - Identify primary and secondary keywords for each topic.
     - Include long-tail keyword suggestions.
     - Develop an internal and external link-building plan.

### Part 3: Content Production and Style

1. **Style Guidelines**:
   - Define the blog’s tone of voice and language:
     - Should it be formal, informal, technical, or friendly?
     - Should it use industry jargon or avoid it?
   - Provide formatting guidance for texts:
     - Use of lists, subheadings, images, videos, and calls to action (CTAs).
