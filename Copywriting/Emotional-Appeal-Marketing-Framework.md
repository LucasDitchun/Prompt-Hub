### Structure and Guidelines for Your Response

1. **Defining the Context and Initial Strategy**:
   - **Identifying the Primary Emotion or Emotional Combination**: Select a central emotion (or a strategic combination) to guide the campaign. Examples include fear (to encourage immediate action), happiness (to create positive associations), guilt (to motivate through responsibility), or other relevant emotions.
   - **Justifying the Choice**: Explain why the selected emotion is the most effective for the specific target audience. Base your justification on psychological insights or examples of past successful campaigns.
   - **Overall Campaign Objective**: Describe the primary objective—such as increasing sales, engagement, brand recognition, or behavior change.

2. **Target Audience Description (Persona)**:
   - Create a detailed profile of the target audience:
     - Age range, location, interests, and behaviors.
     - Key needs, challenges, and motivations.
     - Which values or beliefs can be leveraged to deepen the emotional connection?
     - How does this persona consume information and make purchasing decisions?
   - If relevant, include subgroups within the target audience that may require specific approaches.

3. **Creative Strategy and Core Message**:
   - Develop a clear and emotionally charged core message. The message should:
     - Directly evoke the chosen emotion without ambiguity.
     - Connect the product/service to solving a problem or fulfilling a deep desire.
     - Be memorable, resonate with the persona’s values, and align with the campaign's tone.
   - Provide two or more variations of the message for the user to choose from, with explanations of how each aligns with the target audience.

4. **Communication Channels**:
   - Identify the ideal channels to reach the audience, justifying each choice:
     - Examples: social media platforms (Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn), email marketing, video ads, blogs, live events, among others.
     - Analyze the persona’s consumption behavior to determine the most impactful channels.
     - Propose specific content formats (e.g., Instagram reels for emotional visual appeals, webinars for deeper engagement, etc.).

5. **Call to Action (CTA)**:
   - Create clear and specific CTAs based on the chosen emotion. Examples:
     - “Don’t miss this opportunity” (fear of missing out).
     - “Transform your life today” (inspiration and happiness).
     - “Join the movement” (guilt and belonging).
   - Propose alternative CTAs and discuss where and how they should be presented (e.g., landing pages, emails, banners).

6. **Creative Elements and Practical Examples**:
   - Develop ideas for creative elements that reinforce the emotional appeal:
     - **Visuals**: Use colors, imagery, and icons that evoke the central emotion.
     - **Verbal**: Examples of headlines, slogans, and supporting text.
     - **Narratives**: Suggest stories or scenarios that illustrate how the product/service addresses a specific emotional need.
   - Include at least two detailed examples of campaign pieces (e.g., a draft for an Instagram post, a concept for a video ad).

7. **Metrics and Success Evaluation**:
   - Recommend KPIs to measure campaign effectiveness:
     - E.g., conversion rate, website traffic increase, social media engagement, ROI.
   - Suggest methods for collecting and analyzing data, and how to use insights for iterative campaign adjustments.

8. **Iteration and Continuous Refinement**:
   - At the end of each section, include specific questions to deepen your understanding of the context and adjust details as necessary:
     - What is the biggest challenge your brand faces in reaching the target audience?
     - What makes your product/service unique and valuable to the persona?
     - What emotions do you believe are already associated with your brand?
     - Are there any budget, time, or channel constraints we should consider?

9. **Expected Response Format**:
   - Structure your response using clear headings for each section, with numbered or bulleted lists for organization.
   - Be detailed and provide contextual explanations whenever possible.
   - Include concrete examples, alternatives, and comparisons to enrich the response.
