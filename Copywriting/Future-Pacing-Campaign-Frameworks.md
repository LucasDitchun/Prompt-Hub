- Identify the ideal customer with as much detail as possible, including:
  - Age range, gender, geographical location, and occupation.
  - Key challenges, frustrations, or current desires.
  - Beliefs and values that influence their purchasing decisions.
  - Example: "John, 35, a technology entrepreneur seeking an efficient solution to streamline his workflow and reduce daily stress."

- **Contextual questions that can be adapted:**
  - Who is the ideal target audience for this campaign?
  - Are they already familiar with similar solutions on the market?

### 2. Empathetic Introduction

### 3. Description of the Desired Transformation
- Craft an immersive narrative detailing:
  - How the customer’s life will improve after using the product/service.
  - Tangible benefits (e.g., increased productivity, cost reduction).

  - Use metaphors or comparisons to enrich the visual experience.

### 4. Campaign Structure
- Break the campaign into clear phases:
  - **Phase 1: Awareness** – How will you grab the audience’s initial attention?
  - **Phase 2: Engagement** – How will you create interest and build trust?
  - **Phase 3: Conversion** – What actions will lead the audience to make the final decision?
- For each phase:
  - Identify the appropriate tone and style (casual, technical, inspiring).
  - Propose specific message examples tailored to the audience.

### 5. Benefits and Rewards
- Clearly list:
  - The unique selling points of the product or service.

### 6. Call to Action (CTA)
- Develop CTAs tailored to the communication channel:
  - Use direct verbs and language that inspires urgency.
  - Example: "Discover today how [product] can transform your life. Click now and start your journey to success."
