**Creation Guidelines**:

1. **Structure and Adaptation**:
   - **Adapt the provided template**, preserving its basic structure and integrating creative elements to emphasize the message.
   - If the template isn’t specified, follow well-known frameworks (AIDA, PAS, storytelling).

2. **Engagement with the Target Audience**:
   - Use language that resonates with the target audience, considering their needs, values, and communication style.
   - Include elements that enhance relatability, such as **relevant data, metaphors, or direct questions**.

3. **Coherence and Creativity**:
   - Ensure the content flows naturally and coherently, with seamless transitions between sections.
   - **Inject originality** by incorporating stories, analogies, or a touch of humor (when appropriate).

4. **Writing Techniques**:
   - Use variations in sentence length to create a dynamic rhythm, balancing complexity ("perplexity") and variety ("burstiness").
   - Include a **call-to-action (CTA)** that inspires the desired action, such as "Buy now," "Join the movement," or any other suggested.

5. **Alternative Scenarios**:
   - For a friendly tone: Focus on personal narratives and everyday examples.
   - For a professional tone: Prioritize concrete data and a direct style.
   - For an informative goal: Use lists or bullet points to organize the content.

6. **SEO and Reach** (optional):
   - Include keywords related to the main theme if requested, and structure the text for digital readability.
